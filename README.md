# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction
A Time Series Analysis of Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations to Estimate Upcoming Prices in Real-Time

This is my undergraduate thesis work. This thesis explores the use of time series analysis to predict future values of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, in real-time. The highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it challenging for investors and traders to make informed decisions. The study preprocesses historical price data using various time series models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, to identify patterns and trends. Specifically, the study focuses on hourly and daily data of Bitcoin and predicts the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin for the next hour or day using Basic LSTM, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, CNN-BiLSTM, etc. models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method, which uses the CNN-LSTM model, outperforms other models and has an RMSE of 235.97, an MAE of 135.42, and a MAPE of 0.47%. The findings suggest that the proposed method is effective in predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies in real-time.
